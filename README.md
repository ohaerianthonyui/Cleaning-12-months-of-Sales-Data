# Cleaning-12-months-of-Sales-Data



## Introduction: Data Cleaning, Merging, and Manipulation using Python

In any data analysis project, the quality and preparation of the data are paramount to obtaining meaningful insights. This process is commonly referred to as data cleaning and data manipulation, which involves detecting and correcting (or removing) inaccurate, corrupted, or incomplete records. With Python, particularly using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, data cleaning and manipulation become more efficient and structured, making it easier to prepare raw data for analysis. These techniques ensure that the data is consistent, accurate, and ready for deeper exploration.

In this project, we are tasked with analyzing 12 months of sales data to uncover insights that can help improve business strategy. The first step is to merge the datasets for each month into a single, consolidated file. This is crucial as it allows us to perform comprehensive analyses over the entire year rather than on fragmented pieces of data. Once the data is merged, we can then proceed with data cleaning, which involves handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring the data types are appropriate for analysis.

After cleaning the data, data manipulation will help us to reshape and transform the dataset, facilitating the extraction of valuable insights. Using Python, we can easily group, filter, and aggregate the data to uncover trends and patterns in sales, customer behavior, and product performance.

### Project Objectives:
The primary goal of this analysis is to clean, manipulate, and explore the 12 months of sales data in order to extract actionable insights. Specifically, the objectives are:

Merge the 12 months of sales data into a single CSV file

Combining all monthly datasets into one comprehensive file to facilitate analysis and provide a unified view of the sales data.

Identify the best month for sales and calculate the earnings for that month

Determine which month saw the highest sales performance and calculate the total revenue generated in that month.

Find the city with the highest number of sales

Identify which city had the most transactions during the year and explore any possible patterns related to location-based sales.

Identify the product that sold the most and explain why it had the highest sales

Pinpoint the best-selling product of the year and offer possible reasons behind its success based on the sales data, customer preferences, or external factors.

By achieving these objectives, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the sales performance over the past year and generate actionable insights that can guide future business decisions.
